# Oreo Nord Cursors

This is my fork of [varlesh/oreo-cursors](https://github.com/varlesh/oreo-cursors).

### Changes:

Removed original colours and refactored to use a base directory allowing any color cursor to be generated by editing `generate_colours.py`. Repo has been packacged for the AUR.

### Arch/Manjaro
```bash
    yay -S oreo-nord-cursors-git
```
